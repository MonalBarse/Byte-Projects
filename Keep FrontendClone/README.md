# Keeper App

Keeper App is a simple note-taking application designed to help users organize their thoughts and ideas. With Keeper, users can easily create, edit, and delete notes, making it a convenient tool for capturing important information on the go.

## Technologies Used:

- **React:** Keeper App is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for easy management and organization of the application's UI elements.

- **JavaScript (ES6+):** The application utilizes modern JavaScript features, such as arrow functions, object destructuring, and the useState hook, to handle state management and user interactions effectively.

- **CSS (Tailwind CSS):** Tailwind CSS is used for styling the components, providing a clean and visually appealing design for the Keeper App. Tailwind's utility-first approach makes it easy to create responsive and customizable UI elements.
